End-to-end project on intelligent waste management: image classification with CNN (transfer learning), text classification with SVM, and recycling instruction generation with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

# Waste Management Classification with RAG

This repository contains a full pipeline for **intelligent waste management** using computer vision, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
It demonstrates how AI can classify waste items and generate recycling instructions based on municipal policy documents.

## üìå Project Overview

The system integrates three major components:

1. **Image Classification (CNN + Transfer Learning)**  
   - Uses MobileNetV2 / EfficientNet as the base model.  
   - Classifies waste images into 9 categories.  
   - Includes fine-tuning, regularization, and error analysis.  

2. **Text Classification (Waste Descriptions)**  
   - Processes textual descriptions of waste items.  
   - Implements classical ML (SVM with TF‚ÄìIDF).  
   - Achieves near-perfect classification performance.  

3. **Recycling Instruction Generation (RAG System)**  
   - Embeds and indexes municipal waste policy documents.  
   - Retrieves relevant instructions based on category queries.  
   - Generates structured recycling guidance with citations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-management-classification-rag.git
cd waste-management-classification-rag

Install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended):
pip install -r requirements.txt

üöÄ Usage

1. Image Classification

Run the notebook for image classification:
jupyter notebook waste_management_summative.ipynb

Main steps:
	‚Ä¢	Preprocess images (tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory)
	‚Ä¢	Train CNN model (MobileNetV2 with transfer learning)
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate with accuracy, confusion matrix, and misclassified samples

‚∏ª

2. Text Classification

Uses TF‚ÄìIDF + SVM:
from text_model import classify_waste_description

print(classify_waste_description("empty brown glass bottle"))
# ‚Üí Glass

3. RAG Instruction Generator

Generates recycling instructions from policy documents:
from rag_system import generate_recycling_instructions

out = generate_recycling_instructions("Glass")
print(out["instructions"])

üìä Results

Image Classification
	‚Ä¢	Test Accuracy: ~77%
	‚Ä¢	High performance on Vegetation, Food Organics, and Metal
	‚Ä¢	Confusion mostly between visually similar items (e.g., Glass vs Plastic)

Text Classification
	‚Ä¢	Accuracy: 100% on validation and test sets
	‚Ä¢	Perfect precision, recall, and F1 across all categories

RAG Instruction Generation
	‚Ä¢	Successfully retrieves structured recycling rules
	‚Ä¢	Produces category-specific guidelines with references to policy documents
